Over the many years of craftery the game has festered an arsenal of unfunny inside jokes and references, most of which you will never understand. <br /> Their are rumours that [Scruby](Scruby) once stremaed minecraft on his own channel; sometimes alone, but sometimes joined by [Computerfreaker](https://computerfreaker.pw). Alegedly, they streamed *[Skyfactory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRo8ixh-3q6dno2VFWX-DWCMHzeVBrArb)* for tens of hours at a time. <br />
